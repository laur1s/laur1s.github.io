Hi my name is Laurynas. I work as a Devops Engineer. In this blog I will try to document my work with various technologies as well as well as provide a friendly introduction to them.

Feel free to add or DM me on Twitter [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LaurynasT2) if you have any questions or comments.
