What it means is that these files won't be added to your container image after using ADD or COPY commands. For more information about the .dockerignore please refer to the docker documentation.
For example for Node.js application my .dockerignore file might look something like this:
# .dockerignore# ignore git.git/.gitignore# ignore teststest/# local node modules and debug lognode_modules/npm-debug.</description></item><item><title>First Post: why starting a technical blog is hard</title><link>https://laur1s.github.io/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 14:39:38 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://laur1s.github.io/posts/first-post/</guid><description>As a devops engineer I work with various tools and technologies everyday. Some of them I use everyday or almost everyday (AWS, Terraform, Git , Docker, etc. ) and some only rarely. If you need to use use something you only used a month or two ago chances are you will have to spend some time getting familiar with the tool again. This is where notes come very useful. If you have some notes about what you figured out when using the tool last time it would be much easier to figure out and remember what you did last time.</description></item></channel></rss>
